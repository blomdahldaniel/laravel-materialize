(early build, some bugs and ugly stuff might be in there..)

## Laravel - Materialize

My mission is to make a plattform with Laravel and use Materialize as the front-end framework.
This is supposed to be a repo that can kickstart a project where you want to combine the 2.

### Laravel Documentation

Documentation for the Laravel framework can be found on the [Laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs).

### Materialize Documentation

Documentation for the Materialize framework can be found on the [Materialize website](http://materializecss.com/).

### Contributing

I would enjoy your thoughts on how to build on this repo. Would you like to have a bigger template? Maybe add some admin stuff?
This repo is right now in its early days. There are some known bugs right now:
* Dont get the font material-design-icons to work. Therefore I use font.google....
* asddas

This project is inspired by your way of extracting blade partials.
